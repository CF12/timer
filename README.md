# Timer

A timer app written in ReactJS, because why not.

## Currently supports:
- A timer. Heh.
- Semi-ugly interface to got with that timer (I'll work on it don't worry)
- Digit overflowing to higher place values (You can type 100 in the seconds field, and it'll overflow to 1:00)
- A random CSS ping effect when the timer starts
- More to come?
