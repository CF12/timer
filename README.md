# React Base
This repo contains my own personalized base setup for website projects.
It contains the following:
- React
- Webpack v4.5.0
- Babel Env Loader
- Support for SCSS, as well as normal CSS
- Normalize.css
- PostCSS Support
- Font loading support

Still needs work, but it's pretty minimalistic and doesn't require much effort to use, which is an automatic thumbs up for me. ;D
